		<h2>Bristol and Empire</h2>
		<p>Speakers: Edson Burton, Lawrence Hoo, Madhu Krishnan, Jasmine Ketibuah-Foley (chair)</p>

<p>Bristol, despite its liberal posturing, is a city whose history is intrinsically linked with the British Empire, slavery and the historic crimes that went with it. So much of the effort to engage with this History is stuck simply trying to stop the open celebration of the perpetrators of these crimes.</p>
<p>In this panel we will be trying to move beyond this. We'll ask, what would a radical approach to engaging with Bristol's imperialist past look like? What can activists themselves do to resist the empire apologists and to force the city to engage with it's dark past and take meaningful steps towards making amends?</p>

		<h2>Getting real with strategy</h2>
		<p>Speakers: James Meadway, Sarah Jaffe, Archie Woodrow, Kulsoom Jafri</p>
		<p>There has been a resurgence of leftwing organisations, think tanks, activists, politicians and ideas in recent years, and in America it seems the left is on the brink of power. But all of this happened almost accidentally, and without serious strategic thought. In this session we ask activists from the UK and the States how the left can coordinate with effective strategy to win power.</p>

		<h2>Student housing: university in crisis</h2>
		<p>Ruth Day, Scotty Jennings, Amelia Horgan, Cllr Paul Smith</p>
		<p>Student housing has always been a contentious issue but the explosion in student numbers following New Labour’s Higher Education push has stretched some cities to breaking point. At the same time, developers and wealthy investors have seen the market potential in student housing and have pushed for the further commodification of the student experience. Think £800 a month rooms in an apartment block with a swimming pool and cinema! How do city councils navigate their relationships with Universities, who on the one hand bring investment and employment to a city but on the other expand too rapidly, placing strain on resources and the housing market? How can students who seem powerless to the forces of landlords and capital resist this process?</p>

		<h2>Community Wealth Building</h2>
		<p>Speakers: Martin Parker, Malu garcia, Anita Mangan, Jules Peck, Neil McInroy</p>
		<p>After the 2019 election many of us were left wondering - where do we go from here?</p>

<p>We may have lost the battle but the war isn’t over. We have a network of activist ready and rearing to go. What better way to channel that energy than into community wealth building projects?</p>

<p>But what is community wealth building (CWB)? It's predicated on the idea that the best way to reduce excessive wealth inequality, and promote universal prosperity, is to build a system where people share in the wealth they collectively produce. This is achieved by promoting cooperative businesses, community land trusts, housing co-ops and other such initiatives. In short – CWB aims to transition towards a cooperative economy from the bottom up!</p>

<p>Sound good? In this panel we discuss the successes of previous CWB projects, such as The Preston Model, and how we can replicate it here in Bristol.</p>

		<h2>Political Blackness</h2>
		<p>Speakers: Edson Burton, Samuel Kalejaiye, Rahila Gupta (Southall Black Sisters)</p>
		<p>Historically in the UK many migrants and descendants of migrants organised together to combat racism under the banner of Political Blackness. People of different national and ethnic backgrounds fought racism here and organised against injustices taking place abroad, such as Apartheid in South Africa, using this organising principal, often drawing inspiration from Anti-Colonial and Anti-Racist movements and thinkers internationally. Today it has become increasingly common for people and activists of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds to move away from this sort of collective organising and to identify more closely with a particular ethnic, national or religious identity. Some would argue this allows for more nuance and specificity to enter the discourse around race and racism. Often the difference of emphasis emerges from a generational divide. Are communities of visibly ethnic difference benefiting from a more nuanced a particular approach to the question of ethnic identity, or are we losing a sense of solidartity and collective endevor, or does the answer lie somewhere between?</p>

		<h2>Arguments against Neo-classical economics</h2>
		<p>Have you ever heard an economist or right-wing politician say something you know just isn’t right – but you can’t quite place your finger on what it is? It's easy to get lost when economists and politicians use confusing jargon to obfuscate the truth, masquerading political-ideology as fact. Are skinny jeans and avocado toast really the reason that young people these days can’t get on the property ladder? (...of course not!)</p>

<p>In this workshop we give you a crash course in debunking right-wing economic tropes, giving you the tools you need to start deconstructing the jargon to get to the facts!</p>

<p>This workshop will be run by the Rentier Abolition Project (see rentierabolition.org). Bo Donoghue is a doctoral candidate in Public Policy at the University of Bath and Raven Hart a financial analyst with a Masters of Research in Political-Economy.</p>

		<h2>Sex Work & the Fight for Decrim</h2>
		<p>Speakers: Trixie (SWARM), Frankie Mullin, Katie Cruz</p>

<p>Sex work is often described as the world's oldest profession. Why then are so many in the Labour party and union movement hesitant to recognise sex workers and their rights at work as equal to other workers? We shall look to discuss the various legal models proposed to make sex work safer and empower workers, and why the left is having such difficulty coming to a consensus on this, often ignoring the voice of workers in favour of moralistic and dangerous solutions. Various campaigns exist to tackle this: worker-led SWARM and ECP  Decrim Now in the labour party to union branches of GMB and UVW, workers are fighting to be heard and have their rights taken seriously. </p>

		<p>Speakers: Oscar Burgland, Chris Saltmarsh, Izzy Smythman</p>
		<p>With 10 years left to prevent irreversible damage to our climate and a government utterly uninterested in engaging seriously with climate change, we have to step up our fight. But how? We’ve had decades of letter-writing, lobbying campaigns, direct action on fracking sites and coal mines, divestment campaigns targeting businesses and Universities but is this enough? Should we be changing our strategy, moving onto the streets, causing disruption to big businesses in the City? Or will getting arrested save the planet?</p>
<p>In the past two years, Extinction Rebellion, Youth Strike for Climate, Labour for a Green New Deal have all emerged fighting. Do these new organisations have the answers to fight climate change?</p>

		<h2>Work: Data & Resistance in the Gig Economy and Beyond</h2>
		<p>Speakers: Lina Dencik and Alex Wood</p>
		<p>The rapid development of technologies powered by the collection of data is said to be transforming key aspects of social life, not least the nature of work. Much attention has been on the advent of automation as potentially displacing jobs, or on new forms of labour emerging on and through platforms in a growing gig economy. Standard employment, from retail to hospitality, is also being transformed with the implementation of data-driven tools. Premised on promises of greater efficiency and cost-savings, these technologies are quickly becoming attractive for hiring, directing, monitoring, and assessing workers, often undermining the conditions and rights of workers. How can we resist the exploitative nature of the algorithmic workplace? In this workshop we will discuss different strategies for worker resistance in a digital age, looking at ways of using technologies to mobilise, game and organise alternatives in the gig economy and beyond.</p>

		<h2>The School to Prison Pipeline</h2>
		<p>Speakers: Lana Crosby</p>
		<p>No More Exclusions (NME) is a new UK radical grassroots coalition movement. Their mission is to bring about an end to the persistent race-disparities in school exclusions in the next five years and to affect change at a legal, policy, practice and cultural level in education and society as a whole over the next ten years. </p>
<p>In this workshop you will learn more about NME and the context in which it fits not just in schools but the subsequent trends of excluded children, disproportionately BAME and SEND, who are ending up in our prison system. In addition to contributions from parents, educators and activists you will have a chance to hear from young people who’ve experienced the exclusion system for themselves as well as testimonials of people still incarcerated. </p>
<p>In the short time since it’s founding NME has already made significant inroads in the discussion around exclusions through media coverage and the hard work of it’s activists. Come and find out more about this movement and how you can be part of creating an education system that works for all.</p>
